# Live Retrieval

Surface relevant Open Brain thoughts when context signals suggest they would help.
Silent when nothing is found. Brief when something is.

## When to Fire

This skill fires proactively (not on command) at two moments:

### 1. Session Start

When a new session begins, pull recent context:

```
search_thoughts({ "query": "ACT NOW", "match_count": 3 })
list_thoughts({ "limit": 5 })
```

Surface as a brief note at the top of your first response:
"OB1 context: [1-2 line summary of what's recent]"

If nothing relevant, say nothing.

### 2. Topic Shift Detection

When the user's message contains a recognizable entity (person name, project name,
technology, concept) that differs from what was being discussed, search:

```
search_thoughts({ "query": "[detected entity or topic]", "match_count": 3 })
```

**How to detect topic shifts:**
- A person's name appears that wasn't in the previous 3 messages
- A project or product name is mentioned for the first time in the session
- A technology or framework is referenced that wasn't part of the current task
- The user explicitly says "let's talk about X" or "switching to X"

Do NOT fire on:
- Every message (too noisy)
- Generic words ("the", "code", "fix")
- Topics already being discussed (no shift detected)
- The same entity twice in one session (dedup)

## How to Surface Results

**On hit (score > 0.6):**

Append a brief note to your response. Maximum 3 lines. Do not interrupt flow.

Format:

```
[OB1: Found 2 related thoughts]
- "ACT NOW: [summary]" (captured March 14)
- "[observation about this topic]" (captured March 11)
```

**On miss (no results or score < 0.6):**

Say nothing. The user should never know a search happened and failed.

## Rules

1. **Silent on miss.** No "I searched Open Brain and found nothing." Ever.
2. **Brief on hit.** 3 lines max. The user's task is the priority, not the retrieval.
3. **Dedup within session.** Track which thought IDs you've surfaced. Never show the same one twice.
4. **No more than 3 retrievals per session.** After 3, stop searching. If you're hitting 3 before the session is half over, your topic detection is too sensitive.
5. **Never interrupt.** Context is appended to your response, not injected as a standalone message.
6. **Log every search.** Append to the retrieval log (see below) so you can track hit rate over time.

## Retrieval Log

After each search (hit or miss), log it. This data tells you if the skill is working.

Create or append to `.claude/live-retrieval-log.jsonl` in the project root:

```json
{"timestamp": "2026-03-19T10:30:00Z", "query": "project kickoff meeting", "results": 2, "surfaced": true, "score_max": 0.82}
{"timestamp": "2026-03-19T10:45:00Z", "query": "React server components", "results": 0, "surfaced": false, "score_max": 0.0}
```

After 10 sessions, review the log:
- Hit rate below 20%? Broaden your topic detection.
- Hit rate above 80%? You're probably searching too aggressively. Narrow the triggers.
- Average score below 0.5 on hits? Raise the threshold or improve query terms.

## What This Is NOT

- Not a pre-meeting briefing system (that's Life Engine's job)
- Not a brainstorm context loader (Panning for Gold handles that in Phase 2)
- Not a full-text search tool (the user can call search_thoughts directly if they want that)

This is the ambient, automatic, silent layer that makes Open Brain feel like it's thinking with you instead of just storing for you.

## Failure Behavior

| Failure | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| search_thoughts MCP unavailable | Skip silently. Do not mention it. |
| Search returns error | Log the error, skip silently. |
| Search times out | Skip silently. 5-second timeout max. |
| Results are all low-score (< 0.6) | Treat as miss. Silent. |
